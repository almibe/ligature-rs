# ligature-wasm

This project exposes functionality from the Rust implementation of Ligature to WASM and JS runtimes thanks to wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack.
It can be used by people with no knowledge or interest in Rust or WASM since it is published to NPM and has a purely JavaScript or TypeScript interface available.
